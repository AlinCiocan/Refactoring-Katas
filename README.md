# Refactoring Katas

Can you refactor? In really small steps? Can you turn some, frankly, ugly code into a paradigm of elegant, readable, extensible design?

This repo used to be a collection of starting files for several different code katas, all for practicing Refactoring skills. I have now divided it up so that each kata has its own repo:
