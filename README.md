# Refactoring Katas

Can you refactor? In really small steps? Can you turn some, frankly, ugly code into a paradigm of elegant, readable, extensible design?

This repo used to be a collection of starting files for several different code katas, all for practicing Refactoring skills. I have now divided it up so that each kata has its own repo:

- [Tennis](https://github.com/emilybache/Tennis-Refactoring-Kata)
- [Gilded Rose](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata)
- [Yahtzee](https://github.com/emilybache/Yahtzee-Refactoring-Kata)

For more information about these and other katas, you may be interested in my book [The Coding Dojo Handbook](http://leanpub.com/codingdojohandbook)
